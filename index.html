# Hello There :-)


We're Sarah & Victor

We met at school and both of us wanted to dedicate our diploma project to Open Source.
We wanted to create a “Tool for conviviality”.

So we worked on…


---



# PING (Ping Is Not Googledocs)
Sharing how we document knowledge

---


# Why ? We had a problem …

When someone shares a piece of knowledge, note takers transcript, in their own way, the same content.

But, we can't pull our efforts together and mutualize, in real-time, our notes.

---


# Which has not been solved…

Collaborative text editors like Ehterpad, Googledocs, TitanPad or Framapad already exist. Those groupwares were designed to help closed groups to procude new texts. Not for open groups to take notes…

We even made some researches http://c.sarahgarcin.com/champ

---


# So we cracked our own stuff…
Our tool’s main goal is to allow a personal note taking and, in the same time, a visualisation of the other contributors’s notes. This mutualisation produces an online document upgraded by everyone’s work.

---


# How PING works ? 
[Slide avec un scénario de prise de notes] 
- Prototype -> Demo

---


# And for which context ?
- Brainstorming
- Meetings
- Courses
- Conferences
- Festivals
    - > People the same place at the same time

---



# Who would use it ?

Us. It's a tool we needed. We thought we needed a free and collaborative tool.
So we made it for ourselves so we could then share it with others.

- People who want to share what they learned…
- People like you ?
- Schools & uni ?
