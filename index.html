# Presenting PING 
- tool inspired by free values
- for sharing notes taking in real time

class: center, middle

# Why note taking ?
- A tool we needed
- We think wee need a new free and collaborative tool for classroom, conference, meetings, festival ...
- Tool making for ourselves and then for the others

# Note taking
- wrinting collaborativly and sharing knowledges
- Write collaborativly ? Which practices ? Which applications ? 
    - brainstorming
    - meetings
    - Courses
    - conferences
    - > the same place at the same time
- State of art about tools for collaborative writing -> http://c.sarahgarcin.com/champ
During note taking, everyone is writing the speaker's speach.
We could merge these writings. 
So how to mutualise in real time those notes taking ?

# The idea
PING (Ping Is Not Googledocs) is a numeric tool for sharing notes taking in real time, without disturbing note takers. PING allows a personal note taking, and at the same time, a visualization of others' notes. 

The goal of this polling is to produce a common and shareable document, increased by everyone's work. 

PING's challenge is to modify the way we are taking notes and the way we are sharing knowledges by putting forward the knowledge of everyone.
The audience is not a simple consummer of a speach, but we are its co creator. We are active and enriched by collective knowledges.

# Hypothesis / Scenarios
- We build PING following research logic, making experiments in real context
- How Ping works ? 
[Slide avec un scénario de prise de notes] 
- Prototype -> Demo
- Ideas / futures functionnalities
[site regroupant les gifs - http://sarahgarcin.com/gif-demo/ ] 
    - Time vizualisation ( active / non active moments) 
    - Viewers organisation in real time (most active note taker, non active) 
    - Copy / Paste from another pad with authorship 
    - Star system (joke !) 
    - Adding keyboards shortcuts
    - Images are linked to time - overlapping
